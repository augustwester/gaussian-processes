# Gaussian Process in Python

A bare-bones implementation of Gaussian processes in Python.

If you are unfamiliar with GPs, see the notebook `gaussian_process.ipynb` for a walkthrough of the code. Before you dive into the code, I recommend reading [A Visual Exploration of Gaussian Processes](https://distill.pub/2019/visual-exploration-gaussian-processes/). I also found [this lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vGiHC35j9s) by Nando de Freitas to be quite useful.
